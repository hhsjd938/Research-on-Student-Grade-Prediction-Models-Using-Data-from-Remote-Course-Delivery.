# Research-on-Student-Grade-Prediction-Models-Using-Data-from-Remote-Course-Delivery.
This document provides the details of the Multilayer Perceptron model code from the project. Since the primary guidance for the other models used (such as ensemble, XGBoost, Boosting Tree, etc.) was not under my responsibility, I did not retain any related backups (which have already been handed over to the team leader) to showcase my capabilities with those models. I can write about other models in the future to demonstrate my abilities.
